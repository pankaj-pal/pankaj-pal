## Introduction
This document outlines the design and structure for a Terraform project managing multiple downstream clusters with authentication, authorization, and ArgoCD integration. The goal is to divide the project into smaller, manageable modules and templates to streamline development and deployment processes.

## Project Division
The project is divided into several key modules to encapsulate different functionalities and resources:

### Core Infrastructure Module
Contains shared components like VPCs, subnets, and security groups.

### Authentication and Authorization Module
Handles IAM roles, policies, and identity provider configurations.

### Downstream Cluster Module
Encapsulates resources for each type of downstream cluster.

### ArgoCD Integration Module
Manages ArgoCD installation and configuration on clusters.

### Shared Modules
For common resources or configurations used by multiple modules.

## Template File Management
A `template.tfvars` file is provided to set default values for common variables across clusters. Users can copy and customize this template for each new cluster.

### Template Directory Structure
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ templates
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ template.tfvars
```

### Example Template `tfvars` File
```hcl
# template.tfvars
region = "us-west-2"
instance_type = "t2.medium"
instance_count = 3
# ... other default variables
```

## Environment Setup
Each environment (dev, staging, production) has its own directory with specific `backend.tf` and `terraform.tfvars`.

### Environment Directory Structure
```
.
â””â”€â”€ environments
    â”œâ”€â”€ dev
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ backend.tf
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ terraform.tfvars
    â”œâ”€â”€ staging
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ backend.tf
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ terraform.tfvars
    â””â”€â”€ production
        â”œâ”€â”€ backend.tf
        â””â”€â”€ terraform.tfvars
```

## Module Pinning
Modules are versioned using Git tags or branches. Each environment's `terraform.tfvars` includes the path to the specific version of the module.

## Version Control
A version control system like Git is used to manage different versions of the `tfvars` files. Changes are documented in a `CHANGELOG.md` file.

## Conclusion
The proposed structure ensures a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable. It also simplifies the process of creating and managing multiple downstream clusters.

This design document serves as a high-level guide. Detailed implementation instructions should be provided in the actual project repository, along with comments and documentation for each module and template.
